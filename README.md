# Numerical-Data-Handler
- Use your own Polygon API Key
  - Make a file called polygon_api_key at the root of the project
  - Just have the key at the first line of the file
- You will also need Cloudflare R2 keys
  - Contact me if you do not have them

## Usage
- The loading of data to R2 is already automated, do not attempt to run load_next_month_to_r2.py unless you're Ryan or myself
- An example of downloading the data is in decoding_example.ipynb
